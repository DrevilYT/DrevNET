# DrevNET
A game launcher designed for you. Powered by Steam. Made by Drevil. I had to port the original version to support the Github size limit lol. Note, this launcher is not fully open source, but rather partially open source due to Electron coding restrictions.

TUTORIAL:

Step 1: Download the code from the main branch and extract it.
Step 2: Go to releases and download the latest DrevNET.exe file.
Step 3: Put the DrevNET.exe file in the extracted folder of the main branch.
Step 4: Finally, you can open DrevNET_startup_routine.exe to Launch DrevNET>
Optional Step: You can make a shortcut of the DrevNET_startup_routine.exe file and move it to the desktop or wherever you like for easier access.
